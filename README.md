# Andrew Messer's Coding Portfolio

## Build a portfolio to show potential employers of my previous projects and abilities in Full Stack Web Development

- I want to create a deployed webpage to showcase my coding abilities and the projects I've worked on. 
- I built my portfolio page as a refrence to show potential employers the skills and projects I've contributed to.
- This page gives me a Coding Resume and a place to quickly refrence various projects I've worked on. 
- While building my Portfolio I gained experience in front end development from scratch. Working with HTML and CSS to make a detailed, organized, and responsive website.


## Usage

When you open the webpage you will see a Header with my name/title/picture as well as Navigation tabs that will take you to the About Me, Projects, and Contact info sections on the webpage. If you click on a project photo you will be redirected to the project's URL.
